trinket_box
===========

A box of secret stuff that only unlocks with the right combination of physical tilts...

Inspiration
-----------

Reverse Geo-Cache Boxes are cool, but complicated.
Boxes that lock are fascinating -> primal to the hacking is opening boxes.

So
--

Make a box that senses a sequence of tilts and only unlocks when you get the combination right.
Maybe lights and sound, but keeping it *simpler* than a Reverse Geo-Cache, while still intriguing is the goal.
