===========

A box of secret stuff that only unlocks with the right combination of physical tilts...

Inspiration
-----------

A Reverse Geo-Cache Box is very cool, but rather complicated.
Boxes that lock and unlock are fascinating -> primal to hacking is opening boxes.

So the Goal is
--------------

Make a box that senses a sequence of tilts and only unlocks when you get the combination right.
Maybe lights and sound for a UI to help, but keeping it *simpler than a Reverse Geo-Cache*, and still intriguing, is the goal.

A learning mode would let you set the combination.
Lost the sequence, box locked forever? Hack the chip, load your own softwhatever on it.
